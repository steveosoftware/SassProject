# NATOURS

This webpage is a demonstration of advanced CSS and Sass.  Aside from basic css and using libraries like Bootstrap, Materialize, Semantic UI etc, I didn't have a lot of experience with css.   This project was a great learning experience for me, and I'd like to thank Jonas Schmedtmann for all the help.  From the animations to popup menus, it's all CSS.  No javascript was used in the making of this project.

### Tecninques incorporated into this webpage design:

* Block Element Modifiers
* Responsive images
* Variables and Mixins
* Media queries
* Suport for all major browsers
* Custom grid
